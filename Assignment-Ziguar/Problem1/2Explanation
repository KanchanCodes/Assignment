To find the index of the Current Index Member in the New Task Queue, we need to follow these steps:

Determine the value of the Current Index Member in the Old Task Queue.
Find the index of the Current Index Member in the Old Task Queue.
Remove all inactive members from the Old Task Queue to create the New Task Queue.
Find the index of the Current Index Member in the New Task Queue.
If the Current Index Member in the Old Task Queue is inactive, find the index of the next available member to the Current Index Member in the New Task Queue.
Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem using the given example:

The value of the Current Index Member in the Old Task Queue is the second occurrence of 'A'.
The index of the Current Index Member in the Old Task Queue is 14 (indexing starts from 0).
Remove all inactive members from the Old Task Queue to create the New Task Queue:
Old Task Queue: [A B C D E F A* B C D A B C A B A]
New Task Queue: [B C E F B C B C B]
Find the index of the Current Index Member in the New Task Queue:
The value of the Current Index Member is 'B' (the next available member after the second 'A' in the Old Task Queue).
The index of the Current Index Member in the New Task Queue is 5.
The Current Index Member in the Old Task Queue is not inactive, so we don't need to find the next available member.
Therefore, the index of the Current Index Member in the New Task Queue is 5.
